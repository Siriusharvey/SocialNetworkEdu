that is purchased. Piracy is not tolerated under any

<h2>UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

<ol>
<li>Upload all of the files and folders contained in the "/files" directory in this zip 
to your server. Do not upload install.html, 
license.html, upgrade.html, or changelog.html. 
<br>- Upload all files in the "/images/" and "/include/music_skins/" directories in BINARY mode. Upload all other files in ASCII mode.
<br>- Be sure to set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on all the files in the "/templates" directory.
<br><b>Note:</b> If you have made modifications to your SocialEngine installation, refer to 
changelog.html for a list of files and language variables modified in each version. If you have made 
changes to those files, we suggest using <a href='http://winmerge.org/' target='_blank'>WinMerge</a> 
to consolidate your changes with the new files. Make sure that you also upload "/admin/install_music.php".
<br />
<br /></li>

<li>Once you have finished uploading the files to your server, log into your SocialEngine 
admin panel. On the "View Plugins" page, you will see the plugin you have installed. Click the 
upgrade link.<br />
<br /></li>
<li>
If you have "Subdirectory URLs" enabled, go to your "URL Settings" page. Click the "Save Changes"
button, then select all of the text in the box and copy it. Open a text editor such as notepad, 
and paste the text. Save the document as ".htaccess", and upload it to your server, overwriting
the previous one.
</li>
<li>
You may also want to increase the PHP upload_max_filesize and PHP post_max_size to allow for larger 
uploads. Some hosting providers allow you to do this via your control panel, or by editing the php.ini 
configuration file. Apache based servers may be able to add the following lines to the .htaccess file:

php_value upload_max_filesize 12M
php_value post_max_size 12M
</li>
<li>Be sure to delete the file "admin/install_music.php" when you are finished. 
Leaving this file intact poses a serious security risk!</li>
<li>
Your upgrade is now complete!
</li>
</ol>

<h2>MUSIC PLUGIN 2.X -> 3.X UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

<ol>
<li>The upgrade to 3.0 (and beyond) from 2.2 (or below) involves replacing all of your PHP, TPL, and CSS files. 
This means that you will lose any changes you have made to these files. 
Unfortunately there is no easy way to avoid this since we've made so many 
changes to the platform. If possible, make a note about each change you've 
made in your current installation so that you can reapply them after the 
upgrade process.
Upload all of the files and folders contained in the "/files" directory in this zip 
to your server. Do not upload install.html, 
license.html, upgrade.html, or changelog.html.
<br>- Upload everything in ASCII mode.
<br>- Be sure to set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on all the files in the "/templates" directory.
<br />
<br /></li>

<li>Please note that you will not lose your settings or user data. 
Once you have finished uploading the files to your server, log into your SocialEngine 
admin panel. On the "View Plugins" page, you will see a link that will allow you 
to upgrade to 3.X. This will import all your settings and user data. The only 
data that will be lost is your users' profile styles and their email notification 
settings - unfortunately those could not be easily imported into the new platform.<br />
<br /></li>

<li>Be sure to delete the file "admin/install_music.php" when you are finished. 
Leaving this file intact poses a serious security risk!</li>
</ol>

<h2>SUPPORT</h2>

script's operation, do not hesitate to submit a support ticket via our client
area. We provide support at no cost for one (1) month after your purchase of
the license. Also, if you find a bug at any time, please let us know as soon

using our software as much as we enjoyed creating it!
