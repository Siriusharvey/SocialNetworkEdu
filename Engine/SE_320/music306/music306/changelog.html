<h2>Version 3.00alpha/3.01alpha/3.02beta</h2>
<p>
  The upgrade to 3.00alpha/3.01alpha/3.02beta involves replacing all of your PHP,
  TPL, and CSS files. This means that you will lose any changes you have made to
  these files. Unfortunately there is no easy way to avoid this since we've made
  so many changes to the platform. If possible, make a note about each change
  you've made in your current installation so that you can reapply them after
  the upgrade process.
