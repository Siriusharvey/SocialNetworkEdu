First you`ll has to register user you wish to be friendly ;) :)

In signup.php:

Find: 
// UPDATE SIGNUP STATS
update_stats("signups");


Add under:
$autofriend = new se_user(Array( YOUR USER ID ));
if( $autofriend ) { $new_user->user_friend_add($autofriend->user_info[user_id], 1, '', '');
$autofriend->user_friend_add($new_user->user_info[user_id], 1, '', ''); }



Replace 
"YOUR USER ID" to the user ID you want to be the friend to everyone. This will just be a number. You can see your  users ID`s at control panel->View Users

At end of all firls codeline has to look like this but with your user id:
$autofriend = new se_user(Array( 3 ));

That's it!
