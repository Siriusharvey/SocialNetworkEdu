Do you want each new user that signs up to your social network to automatically receive a message from you? You will be able to send new users a welcome message, saying to them if they needed any help to contact you, etc. If you want to add this to your SocialEngine, follow these easy instructions:

1) Create a new user if necessary. This user will be the one that is automatically sending new users a message.

2) Get this user's user ID. You can get this by going to "View Users" in the Admin Panel and finding the username. The ID is the number in the left-most column.

3) In signup.php, around line 170, there is this code:  
        // UPDATE SIGNUP STATS
        update_stats("signups");

Directly below it, add this code:
  // SEND NEW USER A WELCOME MESSAGE
  $pm_authoruser_id = YOUR USER ID;
  $signup_pm_user = new se_user(array(1));
  $signup_pm_user->user_info['level_message_allow'] = 2;
  
  $signup_pm_user->user_message_send
  (
    /* NEW USER'S USERNAME */
    $new_user->user_info['user_username'],
   'Welcome!', 
   'Hello '.$new_user->user_info['user_username'].', welcome to 4WeedSmokers comunity! If you need any help, please send me a message.'
  );
        
  $database->database_query("INSERT INTO se_pms (pm_authoruser_id) VALUES ('$pm_authoruser_id')");


4) Change YOUR USER ID to the user id you got in step 2.

5) If you wanted to change the Subject and the Message content, the subject is the 'Welcome!' and the message content is the 'Hello '.$new_user->user_info['user_username'].', welcome to social network! If you need any help, please send me a message.'

This part: Hello '.$new_user->user_info['user_username'].'
Allows you to say, Hello [username].

You should be all set. Signup a new user and give it a try!
