<h2>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
	<p>Before you install Badge plugin, you must install these following 
	plugins, which can be downloaded for FREE in your Shop Account Area</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Radcodes Core Library</li>
		<li>Radcodes ePayment System</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After you install those 2 plugins above, you can proceed with the 
	installation below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Upload all of the files and folders contained in this zip file (in the &quot;/files&quot; 
directory) to your server, EXCEPT for install.html, license.html. 
Be sure to upload the files to the directory on your server where you have already 
installed SocialEngine. Upload all files in ASCII mode. <br><br></li>
	<li>Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on all the files in the "/templates" directory.
	<br>Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on  "/uploads_badges" directory. <br>
	<br></li>
	<li>Login to your SocialEngine admin panel. On the "View Plugins" page you will see the plugin 
	you have installed. Click the install link. Your installation is now 
	complete!<br>&nbsp;<br></li>
		<li><span class="style1">Integration for &quot;Special Members&quot; drop-down on TOP MENU.</span><br>Edit 
		&quot;header.tpl&quot; template, put the code below around line 110, (this would 
		make it show up as the last item on TOP-MENU header)<br><code>{include file='badge_topmenu.tpl'}</code><br><br>
		so that the end result would look like this<code><br>{/if}<br>{include 
		file='badge_topmenu.tpl'}<br>&lt;div class='top_menu_link_container_end'&gt;<br>
		<br></code>Of course you can put it in any position on your TOP-MENU if 
		you like.<br>You may also want to make adjustment to these lines as well if 
		your TOP-MENU shows on 2 lines, and break the layout<br><code>{hook_foreach name=menu_main var=menu_main_args complete=menu_main_complete 
		max=XXXX}<br>
		.....<br>{hook_foreach name=menu_main var=menu_main_args start=XXXX}</code><br>
		<br>Just update XXXX to whatever number you prefer, example = 5.<br><br></li>
	<li><span class="style1">If you would like to have "Recent Badge's Members" entries listed on homepage, 
	do the following.</span><br/>1. Edit "home.php", and put in code below<br/>
	<code>$badgeassignments = badgeassignment_get_entries(5);<br>$smarty-&gt;assign_by_ref('badgeassignments', $badgeassignments);
	<br></code><br>Where "5" is the number of job posts you want to show.<br>
	<br>2. Edit "home.tpl" template, and put in code below where you like it to show up<br/>
	<code>{include file='badgeassignment_recent_entries.tpl'}</code><br/>
	<br/><strong>ADVANCED</strong>:


the &quot;<code>badgeassignment_get_entries</code>&quot; also accept additional parameters for further 
filtering and control what entries it should return<br><code>badgeassignment_get_entries($limit, $badge_id, 
	$sort, $where)</code><br><br>where<br>- $limit = 
	the number of entries to return<br>- $badge_id = the Badge ID in your system. Use 0 (zero) 
	means return all new assignments for all badges, otherwise, only return 
	entries of required Badge Id<br>- $sort = default to &quot;badgeassignment_dateapproved 
	DESC&quot;, ie approval date in descending order<br>- $where = extra 
	condition for query<br><br>NOTE: you can virtually use this on anywhere you like, not just homepage. You can also have more than one 
	recent badge assignment blocks if you use different variables for them. <br><br></li>

</ol>
